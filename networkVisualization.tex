\begin{flushleft}
My interest and deep passion for Internet of Things,helping people and more importantly providing people with means to take
care of the enviroment through careful power consumption are the main reasons why I want to do this project. I also want to do
this project because it is an opportunity to learn and see how software and hardware work togther which has always been one of my many interests.The project presents an opportunity to learn new things,acquire new skills and refine my skills and I believe this is the headstart i need for my career in Computer Science.

\subsection{Technical Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
\item Learning the EC2 API 

As this is a very specific technology and one that we have not encountered before but we have a strong believe that 
through more research,more information from the client and our previous experiences with using an API we can overcome this challenge.

\item Retrieving Data from Amazon

This challenge is only due to the lack of information at this stage we plan to overcome this challenge by using either xml or JSON.
