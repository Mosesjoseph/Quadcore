\subsubsection{What makes you want to do the project}
\begin{flushleft}
My interest and deep passion for Internet of Things,helping people and more importantly providing people with means to take
care of the enviroment through careful power consumption are the main reasons why I want to do this project. I also want to do
this project because it is an opportunity to learn and see how software and hardware work togther which has always been one of my many interests.The project presents an opportunity to learn new things,acquire new skills and refine my skills and I believe this is the headstart i need for my career in Computer Science.

\section{Project Execution}
\subsection{Development Methodology}
For this project, there are three main development aspects, first programming the particle that logs data to the server, then the server which processes the data by performing mathematical analysis and finally the user interface provided by the web app where the processed data is displayed and the client is able to view the information.\\


\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pcDevMeth.jpg}

On the first level, that is programming the particle, we would need to read data specific to power consumption and log this data to the server. This data includes data such as voltage and current. This information could be garnered using CT sensors on the electronic device. Once this data is logged to the server then it can be stored in a database so that at a later stage when a client makes a request using HTTPS the data can be retrieved and the necessary calculations can be performed and the server is able to respond appropriately. \\

Based on the above, we have decided to adopt an Agile Development Methodology and more specifically, Extreme Programming. Using this methodology we are able to incrementally build the software system using sprints where specific functionality is completed. We would like to continuously deliver high quality software. This would mean work very closely with the client, Buhler, and more specifically the project owner, Mr. Hanrich Potgieter. As we work together we will be able to identify numerous use cases that will become the focus of the sprints, the development team will complete. \\

Extreme Programming practices focus on having a continuous process, a shared understanding and giving feedback. These principles are important to our project because as previously mentioned, we would like our client to be satisfied hence we need to make sure that we have a proper understanding of their needs and provide them with working progress at regular intervals for their feedback. The practices that are key are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Planning
\item Test-Driven Development
\item Continuous Integration
\item Small Releases
\end{itemize}
The system will thus have to demonstrate working functionality at the end of each sprint and incrementally grow to its best form as it gains aspects of functionality. We will follow a development process of planning, design, implementation and testing at every sprint. In this way, because as the project progresses, development processes are completed as a whole, we only have to revisit completed aspects of the system if we have ways to modify and improve on it and not to make corrections because of faults.\\

In addition to this development process, other aspects of Extreme Programming that will add great value to the development of this power monitoring solution is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pair programming, in this way code is continuously reviewed by the team.
\item Simple Design, in this way every member of the team is able to learn as we go and develop a rounded understanding of the system enabling the production of better software.
\item Sustainable pace, in this way we are able to produce our best work at all times, instead of trying to rapidly produce software that fails.
\end{itemize}
Our starting point will be the collection of data using the particle, and as we work with our client and identify units of functionality we begin the work on the server and interface which will be done simultaneously so that each unit can be put to user testing as the project progresses.
\subsection{Communication With Client}
To keep the clients informed we are going to use the following means of communication
\subsubsection{email}
\begin{itemize}
\item To inform the client of our progress
\item To address any issues or concerns that they client may have
\item To acquire information from the client
\item To require any resources that the client has to offer for their project,..
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Phone calls}
 This will only be used to address very urgent matters if they arise during the course of the project development 
 however this will only be done with permission from the client and during business hours.
 
\subsubsection{Regular Meetings}	 
These will take place depending on the clients availiability and willness.
We may discuss the progress of the project,to address any concerns,etc.

\subsubsection{GIT}

Access to our git repository will be provided to the client,so the client can be able to monitor
our progress and have access to the project material.

We are also open to any means of communicatiuon that the client may prefer or suggest.

\subsection{Technical Challenges}
\subsection{Technologies}
This section will list the technologies that will be used to implement the system.\\
To implement the back-end of the system, the following technologies will be used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item NodeJS will be used to implement the server.
    \item MongoDB will be used to store the data that will be collected.
    \item C++ will be used to program the hardware
\end{itemize}
To implement the front-end of the system, the following technologies will be used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item AngularJS will be used for the web front-end.
\end{itemize}
