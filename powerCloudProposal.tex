\section{Project Execution}
\subsection{Development Methodology}
For this project, there are three main development aspects, first programming the particle that logs data to the server, then the server which processes the data by performing mathematical analysis and finally the user interface provided by the web app where the processed data is displayed and the client is able to view the information.\\


\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pcDevMeth.jpg}

On the first level, that is programming the particle, we would need to read data specific to power consumption and log this data to the server. This data includes data such as voltage and current. This information could be gathered using CT sensors connected to the electronic device. Once this data is logged to the server then it can be stored in a database so that at a later stage when a client makes a request using HTTPS the data can be retrieved and the necessary calculations can be performed and the server is able to respond appropriately. \\

Based on the above, we have decided to adopt an Agile Development Methodology and more specifically, Extreme Programming. Using this methodology we are able to incrementally build the software system using sprints where specific functionality is completed. We would like to continuously deliver high quality software. This would mean work very closely with the client, B{\"u}hler, and more specifically the project owner, Mr. Hanrich Potgieter. As we work together we will be able to identify numerous use cases that will become the focus of the sprints, the development team will complete. \\

Extreme Programming practices focus on having a continuous process, a shared understanding and giving feedback. These principles are important to our project because as previously mentioned, we would like our client to be satisfied hence we need to make sure that we have a proper understanding of their needs and provide them with working progress at regular intervals for their feedback. The practices that are key are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Planning
\item Test-Driven Development
\item Continuous Integration
\item Small Releases
\end{itemize}
The system will thus have to demonstrate working functionality at the end of each sprint and incrementally grow to its best form as it gains aspects of functionality. We will follow a development process of planning, design, implementation and testing at every sprint. In this way, because as the project progresses, development processes are completed as a whole, we only have to revisit completed aspects of the system if we have ways to modify and improve on it and not to make corrections because of faults.\\

In addition to this development process, other aspects of Extreme Programming that will add great value to the development of this power monitoring solution is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pair programming, in this way code is continuously reviewed by the team.
\item Simple Design, in this way every member of the team is able to learn as we go and develop a rounded understanding of the system enabling the production of better software.
\item Sustainable pace, in this way we are able to produce our best work at all times, instead of trying to rapidly produce software that fails.
\end{itemize}
Our starting point will be the collection of data using the particle, and as we work with our client and identify units of functionality we begin the work on the server and interface which will be done simultaneously so that each unit can be put to user testing as the project progresses.
\subsection{Communication With Client}
To keep the clients informed we are going to use the following means of communication
\subsubsection{email}
\begin{itemize}
\item To inform the client of our progress
\item To address any issues or concerns that they client may have
\item To acquire information from the client
\item To require any resources that the client has to offer for their project,..
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Phone calls}
 This will only be used to address very urgent matters if they arise during the course of the project development 
 however this will only be done with permission from the client and during business hours.
 
\subsubsection{Regular Meetings}	 
These will take place depending on the clients availability and willingness.
We may discuss the progress of the project,to address any concerns,etc.

\subsubsection{GIT}

Access to our git repository will be provided to the client,so the client can be able to monitor
our progress and have access to the project material.

We are also open to any means of communication that the client may prefer or suggest.

\subsection{Technical Challenges}
\subsubsection{Collecting the readings}
The sensors or hardware that will be used to collect the physical readings have not been outlined and thus the challenge is how these values will be captured from the operating machinery.\\ \\
The solution:\\ 
Since the boards (photon and electron) have GPIOs, these can be used to interface with the various sensors that will capture the readings such as voltage and current. To measure current, a Current transformer, for example can be used to capture the operating current of a machine.\\
\\
To measure voltage, a step down transformer can be used to step down the voltage of the line connected in parallel to the operating machine. once the voltage has been stepped down to a level that the boards can tolerate i.e the max voltage would be 3.3V logic since the boards can operate at 3.3V VCC, then the signal can be fed to the analog pins of either the photon or the electron board.
\\ \\
These values, voltage and current are essential for the computation of other values such as power, e.g P=VI. 

\subsubsection{Connecting the photon to a local router}
The electron has a direct connection to the internet through the SARA-U260 module. The photon board, however needs a mobile device to get internet connection and thus thus the challenge will be to eliminate the need for a cellphone for the internet connection.\\ \\
The solution:\\
The approach to follow is to use a device that can connect more than one device to the internet e.g a wifi router. The router can provide all the photon boards with a connection to the internet. 
\subsection{Technologies}
This section will list the technologies that will be used to implement the system.\\
To implement the back-end of the system, the following technologies will be used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item NodeJS will be used to implement the server.
    \item MongoDB will be used to store the data that will be collected.
    \item C++ will be used to program the hardware
\end{itemize}
To implement the front-end of the system, the following technologies will be used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item AngularJS will be used for the web front-end.
\end{itemize}
