\section{Project Execution}
\subsection{Development Methodology}
\subsection{Communication With Client}
To keep the clients informed we are going to use the following means of communication
\subsubsection{email}
\begin{itemize}
\item To inform the client of our progress
\item To address any issues or concerns that they client may have
\item To acquire information from the client
\item To require any resources that the client has to offer for their project,..
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Phone calls}
 This will only be used to address very urgent matters if they arise during the course of the project development 
 however this will only be done with permission from the client and during business hours.
 
\subsubsection{Regular Meetings}	 
These will take place depending on the clients availiability and willness.
We may discuss the progress of the project,to address any concerns,etc.

\subsubsection{GIT}

Access to our git repository will be provided to the client,so the client can be able to monitor
our progress and have access to the project material.

We are also open to any means of communicatiuon that the client may prefer or suggest.

\subsection{Technical Challenges}
\subsection{Technologies}
This section will list the technologies that will be used to implement the system.\\
To implement the back-end of the system, the following technologies will be used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item NodeJS will be used to implement the server.
    \item MongoDB will be used to store the data that will be collected.
    \item C++ will be used to program the hardware
\end{itemize}
To implement the front-end of the system, the following technologies will be used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item AngularJS will be used for the web front-end.
\end{itemize}
