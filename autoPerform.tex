\section{Project Execution}
\subsection{Development Methodology}
The project is composed of three core components, the first one being the collection of data from various software systems which is sent to a server, then the programming of the server that will process the information by performing the necessary calculations, and then the design of user interfaces (mobile and web) where the processed data will be displayed to the client.\\
Because our clients happiness is of utmost importance, we have decided to make use of Agile processes. With this approach, we will have deliverables that we will produce on a regular basis and from an early stage. This will facilitate communication between us as the developers and project owner, Mr Schalk Lotz of Magna BC, so that we may work together to develop a high quality system.\\

\subsubsection{Regular Meetings}
These will take place depending on the clients availability and willingness.
We may discuss the progress of the project,to address any concerns,etc.
\subsubsection{GIT}
Access to our git repository will be provided to the client,so the client can be able to monitor

We are also open to any means of communication that the client may prefer or suggest.
